Prepare for a beamtime at ID10-BEATS
====================================

Important information to prepare for your beamtime at SESAME BEATS.

General preparations before arriving at PSI
-------------------------------------------

A few formal procedures must be followed before arriving at PSI as a user. Please refer to the corresponding information on the PSI User Office website: Your stay at PSI.  
In particular, all people coming to PSI to take part in the experiments have to be registered as DUO users and need to request a badge and dosimeter for their visit through the DUO system at least a few days in advance. (They will need the accepted proposal number to schedule a visit to the TOMCAT beamlines. This works even if they are not listed as co-proposers on the original proposal). Without a valid badge, the PSI site cannot be entered!

Safety guidelines and beamline orientation
-----------------------------------------

PSI requires that you and your coworkers comply with all of the institute’s safety rules and regulations while working on the premises. You formally agreed to this by checking the relevant box while submitting your proposal online. It is the main proposer’s responsibility to ensure that all team members who will work at the beamline have read and understood these safety regulations.  
If anything regarding the safety aspects of your experiment changed with respect to what you declared at proposal submission, please let us know as soon as possible, so that the necessary safety assessment can be done prior to beamtime.

Detailed information regarding safety at TOMCAT can be found on the Safety page.  
Failure to comply with the beamline safety advice and PSI regulations could lead to beamtime interruption: your local contact can and will STOP your experiment if during your beamtime safety issues are present or safety is at risk.

As a consequence of the increased acquisition speed over the past few years, beamtime at TOMCAT has become more demanding from the human resources point of view, even more so for complicated ultrafast in-situ and/or multi-days studies. To ensure successful experiments, efficient use of the time, and guarantee the safety of both people and equipment, we ask you to come to the beamline with sufficient staff to be able to work in shifts (and therefore get some sleep).  
We also strongly recommend to always work at least in pairs.

Get in touch with your local contact
------------------------------------

Each user experiment is supported by one of our local contacts, who will be your main point of contact, source of support and information before, during, and after your stay. You can find the name of your local contact in the DUO schedule for the TOMCAT beamlines by choosing the appropriate month for your beamtime.

Further contact information of our staff is available on the staff website.  
We kindly ask you to get in touch with your local contact well before the beginning of your beamtime in order to coordinate the beamtime preparations with him/her: some equipment for your beamtime may need to be installed, reserved or calibrated before your arrival. Some equipment may need to be installed, reserved or calibrated before your arrival.  
Therefore, it is very important for us to know your exact requirements (which maybe not be described in detail in your proposal) well in advance of the scheduled beamtime.

Planning beamline setup
-----------------------

### Detector setup

The TOMCAT beamline is optimised for high-resolution microtomography measurements, i.e., for samples measuring a few mm in width which can be measured at sub-micrometer resolution. Several microscopes with a rather wide range of different objectives (and consequently field of view and resolution) and different detectors are available (see our detectors page). Please note, however, that switching from one system to the other might need extra installation and calibration work at the beamline (up to 1 hour).  
This should be coordinated in advance with your local contact.

### Setup and cleanup time

Setting up your experiment and cleaning up after your measurements is, in general, performed as part of the allocated beamtime. This may include setup changes from one technique or end-station to another, and integration of any custom sample environments in the beamline. Therefore, please plan for enough time at the beginning and the end of your measurements to help us assure a smooth changeover between users and to avoid delays for the next groups following your experiments.

### Technical support

Our technical staff is usually available during normal office hours to help set up more involved experimental configurations with users. If you do require technical support, please notify your local contact well in advance.

Sample preparation
------------------

### Sample shape and size

The optimal sample shape for tomography is a cylinder. Try to prepare your samples as close as possible to such shape. An important parameter to be kept in mind during sample preparation is the sample absorption. Strongly absorbing samples should be kept as small as possible.

### Sample holders

It would be best if your samples were mounted on pins, which fit our 3.15 mm sample holder. For precise specification, please consult: Sample holder specifications.  
Please do not hesitate to contact our beamline technicians (staff website), if you need more details.

### Sample stability

To ensure highest data quality, samples must be stable throughout the entire measurement procedure. Even slight sample instabilities can significantly affect the reconstruction quality. Instability can arise from the reaction of the sample to the X-ray beam (bubble formation, desiccation, etc.), inappropriate sample preparation or fixation method, or from the choice
