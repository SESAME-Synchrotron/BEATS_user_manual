====================
Prepare for Beamtime
====================

.. note::
      Good preparation is essential for efficient and productive measurements.
      Read the points below before your visit to ensure a smooth start of your beamtime at BEATS.

---------------------------------------
Before Arrival
---------------------------------------

The `SESAME User Office <https://www.sesame.org.jo/for-users/sesame-user-office>`_ will contact you to organize your visit, including:

- Guesthouse reservation  
- Access card and site entry  
- Safety training coordination  

Before your arrival, make sure to:

- Communicate to `SESAME User Office <https://www.sesame.org.jo/for-users/sesame-user-office>`_ information about all members of your experiment team.  
- Perform the **safety training**.
- If your experiment involves hazardous or biological materials, contact the local staff and user office.

.. warning::
      Failure to comply with safety or access requirements may lead to delays or denied access.


Bring Enough Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
   - Due to the large size of tomography datasets, **downloading your data is not possible** after the beamtime.  
   - You are responsible for taking a copy of all experimental data before leaving SESAME.
   - Bring **external drives with at least 4 TB of free space**.

Contact The Beamline Staff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each user experiment is supported by a **BEATS beamline scientist**, who will be your main point of contact before, during, and after the beamtime.

- Reach out **well before** your beamtime to discuss your experiment setup. (:doc:`contacts`).
- Communicate if specific sample environments must be installed before your arrival.

---------------------------------------
Safety
---------------------------------------

- All users must comply with `SESAME safety rules and regulations <https://www.sesame.org.jo/for-users/safety-for-users>`_. 
- The **main proposer** is responsible for ensuring all team members have completed safety training and understand the relevant procedures.
- If any safety-related aspect of your experiment has changed since the proposal submission, notify the **beamline staff** immediately.
- Bring enough people and always work **in pairs**, especially for long or complex measurements.  
- Get sufficient rest and plan **shift rotations** for multi-day experiments.

.. _Sample Preparation:

---------------------------------------
Sample Preparation
---------------------------------------

- The **optimal geometry** for tomography is a **cylinder**.
- Follow this `Sample Preparation Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03ZMfrqGOsw>`_.
- Samples can be mounted on standard magnetic holders at the beamline (See :ref:`Sample mount` section).
- Contact the beamline staff if you require adapters or custom mounts.

-------

---------------------------------------
Data Analysis
---------------------------------------

To make efficient use of beamtime, be prepared to **inspect your reconstructed data**.

- You are expected to know basic operations in `ImageJ <https://fiji.sc/>`_.  
- See :ref:`Inspect data with ImageJ` for installation and usage instructions.
- A collection of video tutorials on 3D image processing is available on the :doc:`data_analysis` page.
